            A cup of coffee is a dating app. The semi-serious relationship is a purpose of this app as not having a profile picture of users. The prominent feature is to certify users identity through a company email so that it makes a mood to make a serious relationship, although there is no profile picture.

                Most apps aim to have a casual dating, although there are lots of dating apps on the Korean market. I guessed that It might be a limit of the online app.

                First and foremost, I found an identity certification. In some apps, people claim they are a doctor or working for Samsung, but it hasn't been verified it or they should send a picture of the business card to verify it.

                I came up with what if user verify it by a company mail. Recently, the anonymous community app in Korea to verify their identity by it has been a huge success. I was inspired by the app. Simple and easy to certified through a company email and it provided 100 % reliability.
